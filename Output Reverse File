/*
Lab 2: Write to a file the contents of another file in reverse order.
Author: Arshia Aravinthan


Pseudocode:
Open both files.
Validate that the input file was opened successfully.
Ask user for input and output file names.
Declare 1024-size string array.
Read in the input file word-by-word to the array.
Keep a counter of how many words have been read.
Stop loop if counter reaches 1024.
Then, use a decrementing for loop to write the word held in each index to the
output file in reverse order and print to the screen.
Close files.
