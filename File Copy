Pseudocode:
Define ifstream/ofstream objects and strings
Asks user for full path of file to be read from
Also asks user for full path of file to be written to
Opens both files
Checks that input file opens successfully
If works,
    Read input file character by character
    Copies each character into output file
If not, display error
Pause the program
